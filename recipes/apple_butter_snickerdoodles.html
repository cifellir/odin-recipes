    <p>These snickerdoodle cookies have a hint of apple butter for a different take on the classic favorite.</p>
    <p><h4>Ingredients</h4></p>
    <ul>
        <li>2.75 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>0.5 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>0.5 teaspoon salt </li>
        <li>0.25 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>0.25 teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
        <li>1.75 cups white sugar, divided</li>
        <li>0.5 cup unsalted butter, softened</li>
        <li>1 large egg, at room temperature</li>
        <li>0.5 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>0.75 cup apple butter</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons ground cinnamon</li>
    </ul>
    <p><h4>Steps</h4></p>
    <ol>
       <li>Whisk together flour, cream of tartar, baking soda, salt, 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon, and nutmeg in a medium bowl until combined.</li> 
       <li>Mix together butter and 1 1/2 cups sugar in a large bowl until thoroughly combined. Stir in egg and vanilla until incorporated. Add apple butter and mix until combined. Pour in 1/2 of the dry ingredients and mix until just combined. Add remaining dry ingredients and mix just until no dry clumps of flour remain. Cover bowl and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, or up to 24 hours.</li>
       <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.</li>
       <li>Mix together remaining 1/4 cup sugar and 2 tablespoons cinnamon in a shallow bowl or pie pan. Drop tablespoon-sized pieces of dough into the cinnamon-sugar mixture and roll into balls, coating well. Place 1 inch apart on the prepared baking sheets.</li>
       <li>Bake in the preheated oven until edges are just set, about 10 minutes. Allow cookies to cool on baking sheets for 5 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
    </ol>
